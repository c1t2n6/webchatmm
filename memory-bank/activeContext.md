## Active Decisions

### Deployment Platform: Render.com
**Rationale**: 
- Excellent Node.js support
- Easy GitHub integration
- Free tier available
- Simple configuration
- Good performance for the application size

### Database: SQLite
**Rationale**:
- File-based, no external dependencies
- Perfect for small to medium applications
- Easy backup and migration
- No additional configuration needed

### Authentication: JWT
**Rationale**:
- Stateless authentication
- Scalable and secure
- Industry standard
- Easy to implement and maintain

## Current Challenges

### None Identified
The system is in a stable state and ready for deployment. All core functionality is working and properly configured.

## Monitoring & Health Checks

### Health Check Endpoint
- **URL**: `/health`
- **Response**: JSON with system status
- **Includes**: Database status, memory usage, uptime
- **Purpose**: Monitor application health

### Logging
- **Level**: Configurable via LOG_LEVEL
- **File**: `./logs/app.log`
- **Format**: Structured logging
- **Monitoring**: Real-time log access via Render dashboard

## Success Criteria for Deployment
1. âœ… Application starts successfully
2. âœ… Health check returns "healthy"
3. âœ… Database initializes properly
4. âœ… WebSocket connections work
5. âœ… Authentication system functions
6. âœ… Chat functionality operates correctly
7. âœ… File uploads work
8. âœ… Error handling is robust
